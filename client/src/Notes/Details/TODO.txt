Implement authentication logic (if user is logged in, navigate to the dashboard).

Add functionality for buyers and sellers (listing products, making deals).

Add styling to the Dashboard pages.


✅ 1. Define Clear User Flows
Break the application into the main user journeys:

Buyer flow: Browse → Select Seller/Product → Chat → Trade/Pay

Seller flow: Add Products/Services → View Leads → Manage Transactions

Dashboard: See analytics, transactions, account settings

✅ 2. Set Up Routing with Role-Based Access (React Router + Auth)
Protect routes based on user roles (buyer/seller).

Example:

jsx
Copy code
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute role="seller"><Dashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
✅ 3. Implement User Authentication
Use Firebase Auth, Auth0, or custom JWT-based auth.

Login/Signup page

Store JWT or token in localStorage or context

Set up an AuthContext to manage logged-in state

✅ 4. Build Reusable Components
Create:

Navbar (with dynamic links based on role)

Footer

Product Card / Service Listing Card

Chatbox

Modal for trade confirmation, payment, etc.

✅ 5. Database Integration (Optional Backend or Firebase)
Firebase (Firestore) or Node.js + Express + MongoDB

Store:

User profiles

Products/Services

Messages

Transactions

✅ 6. Set Up Buyer/Seller Dashboard Pages
Each dashboard could show:

Profile details

Active trades

Messages

Stats (revenue, purchases)

✅ 7. Add Chat or Message Feature (Real-Time)
Use Firebase Realtime DB or Socket.io

One-to-one messaging between buyer and seller

✅ 8. Trade Workflow System
Define trade states like:

Requested

Accepted

In progress

Completed

Track this via UI cards and backend records.

✅ 9. Payments (If Needed)
Integrate Razorpay, Stripe, or Paytm for handling payments.

✅ 10. Make it Visually Appealing
Use TailwindCSS, Material-UI, or your custom design

Stick to a modern, clean color palette and layout
